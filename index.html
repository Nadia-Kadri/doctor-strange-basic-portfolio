      <h1>About Doctor Strange</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/doctor-strange-animation-3.jpeg" alt="Doctor Strange Photo" width="400px">
      <p>Dr. Stephen Strange, M.D., a.k.a. Doctor Strange, was the Sorcerer Supreme for Earth-616. Strange was once a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, until a car accident crippled his hands. When modern medicine failed him, he embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj in Tibet, where he was trained by the Ancient One. He healed his hands and learned more about Magic, eventually becoming a Master of the Mystic Arts. He settled in the Sanctum Sanctorum in Greenwich Village, New York City, becoming the Earth's protector from any mystical threats.</p>
