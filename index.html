      <p>Dr. Stephen Strange, M.D., a.k.a. Doctor Strange, was the Sorcerer Supreme for Earth-616. Strange was once a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, until a car accident crippled his hands. When modern medicine failed him, he embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj in Tibet, where he was trained by the Ancient One. He healed his hands and learned more about Magic, eventually becoming a Master of the Mystic Arts. He settled in the Sanctum Sanctorum in Greenwich Village, New York City, becoming the Earth's protector from any mystical threats.</p>
      <p>A Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange has phenomenally powerful magical abilities that enable him to skillfully conjure myriad spells. Strange has been able to use his spells to bind opponents and create complex shields and barriers, among many other uses for both defense and attack. Strange is also adept at astral projection, sending his astral self away from his body and allowing him to observe events without the knowledge of those present.</p>
      <p>Arguably, the Eye of Agamotto provides the greatest source of power to Strange. In truth the Infinity Stone known as the Time Stone, the Eye possesses the incalculable ability to control time itself. With it, Strange can alter time around objects, locations or other beings, moving forward and backward through their existence. It can also be used to trap enemies in time loops, as well as giving Strange the ability to look forward into potential futures.</p>
